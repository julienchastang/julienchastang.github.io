      <description>The books I read in 2022:
The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde On the Road by Jack Kerouac Littérature française: Les Trois Mousquetaires by Alexandre Dumas La Guerre de Cent Ans by Jean Favier Yet another poor year for not completing many books though in my own defense a couple of them were quite long. Hopefully, 2023 will be better in the reading category.</description>

      <title>Update: Installing X11 Emacs with homebrew</title>
      <link>https://julienchastang.com/post/x11-update/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>

      <guid>https://julienchastang.com/post/x11-update/</guid>
      <description>In 2019, I wrote about maintaining my own homebrew formula for X11 emacs. I continue to maintain this bit of code from time to time. Moreover, homebrew no longer support &amp;lsquo;with&amp;rsquo; style options (e.g., --with-x11 ) so the installation command has changed:
brew reinstall --build-from-source emacs
You will find homebrew-core in /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core. Once you have my homebrew GitHub fork, run that command to install X11 emacs. There are no additional options with that command.</description>

      <title>For Security Purposes, Regularly Expunge Your macOS Clipboard</title>
      <link>https://julienchastang.com/post/pbcopy/</link>

      <description>I was recently surprised to find some sensitive data in my macOS clipboard that I must have unintentionally copied there earlier. This information could accidentally leak out as a result of an unfortunate or inadvertent paste in a shared Google Doc, for example. Moreover, there is an abundance of evidence on the Internet concerning clipboards as hacking attack vectors.
As a result, I have added the following entry to my crontab:</description>

      <title>Books I Read in 2020</title>

      <guid>https://julienchastang.com/post/books-2020/</guid>
      <description>2020 was not quite the year I had hoped for in terms of reading or blogging. Anyway, here is my reading list for the last year:
The Snowflake by Kenneth Libbrecht The Columbian Exchange: Biological and Cultural Consequences of 1492 by Alfred W. Crosby Matilda by Roald Dahl (I read a French translation of this book with my daughter.) Littérature française Le Comte de Monte-Cristo (~1500 pages!) by Alexandre Dumas Les Liaisons Dangereuses by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos Le Père Goriot by Honoré de Balzac La Chartreuse de Parme by Stendhal Let&amp;rsquo;s hope life can get back to normal in 2021.</description>

      <title>Join lines, vi-style in Emacs</title>
      <link>https://julienchastang.com/post/join-lines/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Oct 2019 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>

      <guid>https://julienchastang.com/post/join-lines/</guid>
      <description>I mostly edit in Emacs but occasionally I like to use vi. vi is often the only editor available in certain computing environments. In Emacs, I find myself missing vi&amp;rsquo;s join line capability. Emacs&amp;rsquo; closest equivalent is M-^ or the unintuitively named delete-indentation function. M-^ is awkward in that it joins the current line to the previous line. This behavior feels unnatural especially when joining many lines in succession where you have to go to the end of the block you want to join and repeatedly type M-^.</description>

      <title>Extending Emacs rgrep for Org Mode Only Search</title>
      <link>https://julienchastang.com/post/rgrep/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 May 2019 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>

      <guid>https://julienchastang.com/post/rgrep/</guid>
      <description>I recently wanted to extend emacs rgrep to search within org files only. Here is what I came up with:
(defun jc/rgrep-org (regexp dir) &amp;#34;rgrep for org files only&amp;#34; (interactive (progn (grep-compute-defaults) (let* ((regexp (grep-read-regexp)) (dir (read-directory-name &amp;#34;Base directory: &amp;#34; nil default-directory t))) (list regexp dir)))) (rgrep regexp &amp;#34;*.org&amp;#34; dir nil)) Note that in order to get this jc/rgrep-org function to work, I had to study and borrow from the internals of rgrep.</description>

      <title>Installing X11 Emacs with homebrew</title>
      <link>https://julienchastang.com/post/x11/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 May 2019 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>

      <guid>https://julienchastang.com/post/x11/</guid>
      <description>Edit: As of &amp;lt;2021-10-04 Mon&amp;gt;, this post is out of date. Please see here for updated instructions.
A while back it was decided that X11 support would be removed from homebrew-core. Taking matters into my own hands and in the spirit of OSS, I now maintain my own version for anyone who wants it. On MacOS, you will find homebrew-core in /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-core.
Once you have the fork brew reinstall emacs --with-x11.</description>
