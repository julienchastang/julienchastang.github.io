i am scientific software developer living in beautiful [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado][Boulder, Colorado USA]]. I am passionate about the application of computing technology to science and math. I am currently employed at the [[http://www.unidata.ucar.edu][Unidata Program Center]] and have been part of the [[http://www.ucar.edu][UCAR organization]] [fn:1] since 1999 when I started here as a [[http://www.ucar.edu/communications/staffnotes/9907/newhires.html][student]]. I specialize in scientific data, metadata, analysis and visualization using a variety of programming languages and technologies.
